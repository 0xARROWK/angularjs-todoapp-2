## In which context did I this project?

We did this project as part of our studies in IT. This project was part of the lesson on the web development, this is why we used angularjs.

## The goal of the project

The goal of the project is to create a responsive todo list web application using AngularJS. The goal is to create a single page application which is able to add, remove, watch a task. The important part was to have a working application which is responsive because we haven't a lot of time. Finally, the goal is to create an android application with this code using cordova.

## The progress of the project

We were able to create this web application in this short time. The web application is responsive and the user is able to add, remove and watch a task in a single page application. The application works well. It could be cool to develop the multi language part of the project. Finally, you can find here the android application which has been generate with cordova here : https://github.com/Kierian-50/toDo-app-cordova. The android application also works well, the respensive is very good but we find an issue, when we click on the logo of the application, then we're not able to click on the logo app that redirect the user at the main view, we must close the app and restart it and next the application works again. We didn't have the time to fix this bug.
